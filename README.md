# SteadtlerHR
Built with ASP.NET Core MVC 3.1 and SQL Server 2019.
I built this employee data management app - SteadtlerHR - using which an organization can maintain employee data. 
Using this application an organization can create new employees, update data of existing ones, delete entries, and also look up employee 
details.
The app utilizes the core functionalities of the ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC framework like Razor Pages, Razor Views, Tag Helpers, etc.,
The employee data is accessed using SQL stored procedures that I wrote using the SQL Server Management Studio.
